1. The "Transition Period" Trap
The most significant lesson from Noble and Bracamonte is that a "transition" period usually counts as California residency. Taxpayers often believe residency changes when they decide to move or sign a lease elsewhere, but the courts focus on where the benefits of residency were enjoyed on the specific day income was realized.
• What Taxpayers Did Wrong:
    ◦ In Noble: The taxpayers declared they were Colorado residents as of March 1, ostensibly because they intended to move. However, they sold stock for a large gain on March 7 and March 25. During that specific month, they had not yet physically moved their furniture, they spent no time in Colorado, and they were still using California doctors and clubs,,.
    ◦ In Bracamonte: The taxpayers rented an apartment in Nevada on March 6 and claimed residency. However, between then and the sale of their business in July, they spent 90 days in California versus only 28 days in Nevada,.
• New Lesson: You cannot be in a "transition" status. You are a California resident until the moment you physically arrive in the new state with no intent to return. Being in the process of moving does not exempt you from tax on income realized during the process,.
• Specific Evidence That Would Have Helped:
    ◦ Transaction Timing: Delaying the sale of stock or business interests until after the physical move is complete and the majority of belongings are moved,.
    ◦ Physical Presence Logs: Proof that on the specific days income was realized (e.g., the day of the stock sale), the taxpayer was physically present in the new state.
2. The "Impermanence" of the New Abode
Bracamonte introduces a critical psychological factor used by auditors: the comparison of the "permanence" of the two homes.
• What Taxpayers Did Wrong:
    ◦ The taxpayers kept a large, owned home in California (Escondido) while renting a temporary apartment in Nevada. The court noted they only moved "linens, towels, dishes and some basic furniture" to Nevada.
    ◦ Crucially, they left "precious mementos and other valuable items" in California. The court viewed the Nevada apartment as a mere "stopgap" or "limited purpose" housing, which is insufficient to establish domicile.
• New Lesson: "Trading down" from a large owned home in CA to a rented apartment in a new state signals a lack of intent to remain permanently.
• Specific Evidence That Would Have Helped:
    ◦ Moving Heirlooms: A moving bill of lading or inventory list showing that sentimental items (photos, art, heirlooms) were moved to the new state immediately.
    ◦ Comparable Living Standards: Purchasing a home in the new state that is comparable in size or value to the California home prior to the income event.
    ◦ Immediate Listing: Listing the California home for sale immediately upon leaving, rather than holding it due to "market conditions".
3. The "Marital Abode" and Job Convenience
The Appeal of Mazer refines the rules regarding moving for employment. It highlights that even a two-year move might not break California domicile if the spouse remains behind.
• What Taxpayers Did Wrong:
    ◦ The husband moved to Malaysia for a 2-year contract but left his wife and adult daughter in their California home.
    ◦ He relied on an employment contract that said it "may be renewable" to prove indefinite intent. The court ruled this was not enough to prove he intended to stay indefinitely.
    ◦ He lived in an apartment and drove a car provided and paid for by his employer. The court viewed these as "matters of job convenience" rather than the taxpayer establishing his own permanent ties,.
• New Lesson: If one spouse leaves for a fixed term (even if renewable) and the other stays in the "marital abode," the domicile usually remains California,. Ties paid for by an employer (corporate housing) are given little weight in establishing a new domicile.
• Specific Evidence That Would Have Helped:
    ◦ Spousal Relocation: Evidence that the spouse also moved to the new location.
    ◦ Independent Ties: Signing a lease in the taxpayer's own name (not the employer's) and obtaining a local driver's license, even if the employer provides transportation,.
4. The "Trailing Tax" on RSUs (Restricted Stock Units)
The two Chief Counsel Rulings (2013-02 and 2014-01) provide a mathematical formula for income that "trails" a taxpayer after they leave.
• The Issue: Taxpayers often assume that if they are nonresidents on the day their Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) vest, they owe no California tax. These rulings clarify that California taxes the labor performed in the state, even if the payout happens later.
• New Lesson (The Allocation Formula): If RSUs are granted while a resident but vest after becoming a nonresident, the income must be allocated. The formula is: 
Total Gain× 
Total Working Days (Grant to Vest)
California Working Days (Grant to Vest)
​
 
 ,,.
• Specific Evidence That Would Have Helped:
    ◦ Detailed Workday Calendars: To minimize tax, the taxpayer needs a precise count of days worked outside California between the grant date and the vest date. Without this, the FTB may assume all workdays were California days,.
    ◦ Grant vs. Vest Schedules: Documentation clearly establishing the "Grant Date" and "Vest Date" to define the allocation period.


 The "Impermanence" & "Stopgap" Factor
The Appeal of Bracamonte introduces a critical lesson about the nature of the first home secured in the new state. A rental is often viewed as a "stopgap," not a domicile change, if it significantly differs in quality from the California home retained.
• What Taxpayers Did Wrong:
    ◦ The "Stopgap" Rental: The taxpayers rented an apartment in Nevada to "make purchasing a home easier" later, while retaining a large home in Escondido, CA. The OTA viewed the rental as "marked with impermanence".
    ◦ The "Linens vs. Mementos" Test: They only moved "essentials" like linens, towels, and dishes to Nevada. They left "precious mementos and other valuable items" in California.
    ◦ Bad Timing on Toys: They purchased a Harley-Davidson motorcycle in May/June (during the transition) and registered it in California, not Nevada,.
• Specific Evidence That Would Have Helped:
    ◦ Inventory of Valuables: A moving company manifest proving that "precious mementos" (art, heirlooms, photo albums) were moved to the rental immediately, rather than left in the CA home.
    ◦ Comparable Housing: Obtaining a residence in the new state that is comparable in size or status to the CA home, rather than a temporary apartment.
    ◦ Vehicle Registration: Ensuring any new vehicle purchased during the transition is registered immediately in the new state.
2. The "Indefinite Business Expansion" Factor
The Appeal of Housman and Pena creates a dangerous precedent for entrepreneurs coming to California to set up a US branch of a foreign company.
• What Taxpayers Did Wrong:
    ◦ Misunderstanding "Temporary": The taxpayers moved to CA to expand their Australian business. They argued this was "temporary" because they intended to return to Australia eventually,.
    ◦ Indefinite Contracts: The management agreement regarding the expansion had no end date. The OTA ruled that expanding a business into a new market is an "indefinite" purpose, making them residents.
    ◦ Filing Consistency: They filed as California residents for years, then tried to retroactively claim nonresidency for the year of a big sale.
• Specific Evidence That Would Have Helped:
    ◦ Fixed-Term Project Contracts: Documents proving the stay was for a "particular transaction, contract, or engagement" with a short, defined duration, rather than a general "market expansion".
    ◦ Consistent Nonresident Filings: Filing nonresident returns from year one, rather than filing resident returns and amending them later.
3. The "Romantic Partner" Anchor (Fiancée Factor)
While previous cases focused on spouses (Mazer confirms leaving a wife in CA retains domicile), the Appeal of Beckwith extends this to non-marital romantic partners.
• What Taxpayers Did Wrong:
    ◦ The Fiancée Move-In: The taxpayer (moving to CA) bought a home in CA and his fiancée moved in. The OTA cited the fiancée’s location as a "significant factor" in establishing his intent to remain in CA, even though they were not yet married.
    ◦ Remodel Supervision: The taxpayer stayed in the CA home to "oversee the remodel," which the court viewed as availing himself of the benefits of the state.
• Specific Evidence That Would Have Helped:
    ◦ Separate Residences: Evidence that the romantic partner maintained their own separate residence during the transition period.
    ◦ Investment Intent: If claiming a home is for investment (as Beckwith did), there should be lease agreements or listing documents, not a fiancée living there rent-free,.
4. FTB Enforcement: The "Mortgage Multiple" & "Last Known Address" Traps
The Greenberg Traurig Alert highlights aggressive FTB tactics regarding how they find and assess nonresidents, often without an audit first.
• What Taxpayers Do Wrong:
    ◦ Ignoring the "Last Known Address": The FTB sends "Filing Enforcement Program" (FEP) notices to the taxpayer's last known address (usually the old CA home). Taxpayers move, miss the notice, and the assessment becomes final.
    ◦ Triggering Algorithms: The FTB data-mines federal returns. If a nonresident deducts mortgage interest for a CA property on their federal return, the FTB may assume they are a resident.
• The "Pro Forma" Mistake:
    ◦ The FTB uses a "multiple of the mortgage interest" to guess the taxpayer's income. For example, if you deduct CA mortgage interest, they multiply that number to estimate your total income and send a tax bill based on that guess. They do the same with car lease payments.
• Specific Evidence That Would Have Helped:
    ◦ Address Update Confirmation: Proof that the taxpayer formally updated their address with the FTB immediately upon moving to ensure they receive FEP notices.
    ◦ Occupational License Updates: The FTB mines data on "occupational or local tax licenses" (e.g., a lawyer or CPA license). Taxpayers must provide proof that these were inactivated or updated to nonresident status,.
5. Job Convenience vs. Significant Ties
The Appeal of Mazer clarifies that employer-provided perks do not count as establishing a new domicile.
• What Taxpayers Did Wrong:
    ◦ Relying on Corporate Housing: The taxpayer argued he established a new domicile in Malaysia because he had an apartment and a car there. The OTA rejected this because they were leased/paid for by the employer. These were viewed as "matters of job convenience," not the taxpayer putting down roots.
• Specific Evidence That Would Have Helped:
    ◦ Personal Liability: Leases and vehicle registrations in the taxpayer's own name, paid from personal funds, to show independent intent to establish a home.
